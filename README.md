# Summary of what a README.md is:

This is a template document meant to clearly and concisely convey what your application does and how it works. This is meant to advertise and encourage people to use your application.

All of the following sections are recommended but order and naming of the sections is only encouraged. We only _require_ the Code.gov Registration Info section at the bottom of your README document.
